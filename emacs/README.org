** Emacs in server mode

  If you want up emacs in server mode, you just need to add command belove to some start-up file. For example ~.Xprofile~, or another place in system initilization queue.
 
  #+begin_src sh
    /usr/bin/emacs --daemon &
  #+end_src

  When you want to edit something, or open dired, or ivoke some command, use ~emacsclient~
   
  #+begin_src sh
    # edit file "some.txt"
    /usr/bin/emacsclient -c -a "emacs" "some.txt"
    # open dired in place
    /usr/bin/emacsclient -c -a '' ~/Documents/
    # Eval `ranger` file manager
    /usr/bin/emacsclient -c -a emacs --eval '(ranger)'
    
    # But you always can do some aliaces 
    # for open file or command in easy way
    alias emdit="emacsclient -c -a emacs"
    alias emdit-nw="emacsclient -nw -c -a emacs"
    alias emcalc="emacs -f full-calc"
    alias emcalc-nw="emacs -nw -f full-calc"
  #+end_src
 
  If you want to use emacsclient to open some files in =nautilus= or make client mode of emacs as desktop icon, you need to create in path =/usr/share/applications/= or =~/.local/share/applications/= file with name [[https://github.com/SerhiiRI/config-files/blob/master/emacs/emacsclient.desktop][emacsclient.desktop]], which being visible from GTK toolkits

** Emacs daemon 

  Alternative way, you can create Unit file [[https://github.com/SerhiiRI/config-files/blob/master/emacs/emacs.service][emacs.service]]. All you need to do is put file to path =~/.config/systemd/user/emacs.service= 
  After that turn on service in systemd:
  
  #+begin_src sh
    systemctl enable --user emacs
    systemctl start --user emacs
  #+end_src
